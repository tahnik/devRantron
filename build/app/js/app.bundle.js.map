* @class Autolinker\n * @extends Object\n *\n * Utility class used to process a given string of text, and wrap the matches in\n * the appropriate anchor (&lt;a&gt;) tags to turn them into links.\n *\n * Any of the configuration options may be provided in an Object (map) provided\n * to the Autolinker constructor, which will configure how the {@link #link link()}\n * method will process the links.\n *\n * For example:\n *\n *     var autolinker = new Autolinker( {\n *         newWindow : false,\n *         truncate  : 30\n *     } );\n *\n *     var html = autolinker.link( \"Joe went to www.yahoo.com\" );\n *     // produces: 'Joe went to <a href=\"http://www.yahoo.com\">yahoo.com</a>'\n *\n *\n * The {@link #static-link static link()} method may also be used to inline\n * options into a single call, which may be more convenient for one-off uses.\n * For example:\n *\n *     var html = Autolinker.link( \"Joe went to www.yahoo.com\", {\n *         newWindow : false,\n *         truncate  : 30\n *     } );\n *     // produces: 'Joe went to <a href=\"http://www.yahoo.com\">yahoo.com</a>'\n *\n *\n * ## Custom Replacements of Links\n *\n * If the configuration options do not provide enough flexibility, a {@link #replaceFn}\n * may be provided to fully customize the output of Autolinker. This function is\n * called once for each URL/Email/Phone#/Hashtag/Mention (Twitter, Instagram)\n * match that is encountered.\n *\n * For example:\n *\n *     var input = \"...\";  // string with URLs, Email Addresses, Phone #s, Hashtags, and Mentions (Twitter, Instagram)\n *\n *     var linkedText = Autolinker.link( input, {\n *         replaceFn : function( match ) {\n *             console.log( \"href = \", match.getAnchorHref() );\n *             console.log( \"text = \", match.getAnchorText() );\n *\n *             switch( match.getType() ) {\n *                 case 'url' :\n *                     console.log( \"url: \", match.getUrl() );\n *\n *                     if( match.getUrl().indexOf( 'mysite.com' ) === -1 ) {\n *                         var tag = match.buildTag();  // returns an `Autolinker.HtmlTag` instance, which provides mutator methods for easy changes\n *                         tag.setAttr( 'rel', 'nofollow' );\n *                         tag.addClass( 'external-link' );\n *\n *                         return tag;\n *\n *                     } else {\n *                         return true;  // let Autolinker perform its normal anchor tag replacement\n *                     }\n *\n *                 case 'email' :\n *                     var email = match.getEmail();\n *                     console.log( \"email: \", email );\n *\n *                     if( email === \"my@own.address\" ) {\n *                         return false;  // don't auto-link this particular email address; leave as-is\n *                     } else {\n *                         return;  // no return value will have Autolinker perform its normal anchor tag replacement (same as returning `true`)\n *                     }\n *\n *                 case 'phone' :\n *                     var phoneNumber = match.getPhoneNumber();\n *                     console.log( phoneNumber );\n *\n *                     return '<a href=\"http://newplace.to.link.phone.numbers.to/\">' + phoneNumber + '</a>';\n *\n *                 case 'hashtag' :\n *                     var hashtag = match.getHashtag();\n *                     console.log( hashtag );\n *\n *                     return '<a href=\"http://newplace.to.link.hashtag.handles.to/\">' + hashtag + '</a>';\n *\n *                 case 'mention' :\n *                     var mention = match.getMention();\n *                     console.log( mention );\n *\n *                     return '<a href=\"http://newplace.to.link.mention.to/\">' + mention + '</a>';\n *             }\n *         }\n *     } );\n *\n *\n * The function may return the following values:\n *\n * - `true` (Boolean): Allow Autolinker to replace the match as it normally\n *   would.\n * - `false` (Boolean): Do not replace the current match at all - leave as-is.\n * - Any String: If a string is returned from the function, the string will be\n *   used directly as the replacement HTML for the match.\n * - An {@link Autolinker.HtmlTag} instance, which can be used to build/modify\n *   an HTML tag before writing out its HTML text.\n *\n * @constructor\n * @param {Object} [cfg] The configuration options for the Autolinker instance,\n *   specified in an Object (map).\n */\nvar Autolinker = function( cfg ) {\n\tcfg = cfg || {};\n\n\tthis.version = Autolinker.version;\n\n\tthis.urls = this.normalizeUrlsCfg( cfg.urls );\n\tthis.email = typeof cfg.email === 'boolean' ? cfg.email : true;\n\tthis.phone = typeof cfg.phone === 'boolean' ? cfg.phone : true;\n\tthis.hashtag = cfg.hashtag || false;\n\tthis.mention = cfg.mention || false;\n\tthis.newWindow = typeof cfg.newWindow === 'boolean' ? cfg.newWindow : true;\n\tthis.stripPrefix = this.normalizeStripPrefixCfg( cfg.stripPrefix );\n\tthis.stripTrailingSlash = typeof cfg.stripTrailingSlash === 'boolean' ? cfg.stripTrailingSlash : true;\n\n\t// Validate the value of the `mention` cfg\n\tvar mention = this.mention;\n\tif( mention !== false && mention !== 'twitter' && mention !== 'instagram' ) {\n\t\tthrow new Error( \"invalid `mention` cfg - see docs\" );\n\t}\n\n\t// Validate the value of the `hashtag` cfg\n\tvar hashtag = this.hashtag;\n\tif( hashtag !== false && hashtag !== 'twitter' && hashtag !== 'facebook' && hashtag !== 'instagram' ) {\n\t\tthrow new Error( \"invalid `hashtag` cfg - see docs\" );\n\t}\n\n\tthis.truncate = this.normalizeTruncateCfg( cfg.truncate );\n\tthis.className = cfg.className || '';\n\tthis.replaceFn = cfg.replaceFn || null;\n\tthis.context = cfg.context || this;\n\n\tthis.htmlParser = null;\n\tthis.matchers = null;\n\tthis.tagBuilder = null;\n};\n\n\n\n/**\n * Automatically links URLs, Email addresses, Phone Numbers, Twitter handles,\n * Hashtags, and Mentions found in the given chunk of HTML.
